# linear-regression
the implementation of linear regression based on a dataset of single variable.
## This contain the dataset on which the linear regression is imposed:-
[The dataset](https://github.com/eaz-yeah/linear-regression/blob/main/single_variable.csv) we used have one variable as input and the second columns of the dataset act as the output.

## This contains the folder which has the implementation of linear regression algorithm which develops a linear relation between the data and the target.
[The code](https://github.com/eaz-yeah/linear-regression/blob/main/linear%20regression%20with%20single%20variable.ipynb) consist of the:- 
1. Implementation of the linear regression.
2. we will use concept of fit algorithms which is implemented in scikitlearn
3. We will also split our data into x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test 
4. We plotted various graphs based on predicted y's and actual y using matplotlib.
